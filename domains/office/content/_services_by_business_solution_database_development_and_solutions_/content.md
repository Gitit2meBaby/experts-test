Our experts are highly skilled in Microsoft database development. If you need help designing or determining what is best for your business, our experienced programmers can help analyse and develop a database solution that suits your organisation’s requirements. Our experienced database consultants are ready to help.

Access is an efficient, reliable and cost effective desktop database management solution. Often the “go to” solution when Excel workbooks get too big and complex, Access can organise data more efficiently, better maintain data integrity and provide simultaneous multi-user access to your data. Scalable and easily handling most business processes, Access provides a rich forms based GUI with powerful querying, reporting and charting tools.

A native Access database can be setup as single user and stand-alone, or multi-user by accessing a central data store across a LAN, supporting up to about 15 concurrent users. Access uses its own JET database engine and can link to various data sources including Excel, Outlook, text files, XML data and SQL data sources via ODBC, including Microsoft’s Azure cloud SQL data store. Access is supported by VBA, so it can handle complex logic and seamlessly integrate with Office products such as Word, Excel or Outlook using “automation”. Access can also integrate with 3rd party software such as MYOB or Xero.

With a lot of data, over 15 concurrent users or a need to extend access to your data, you’ll need an SQL Server database which can be installed on your local network or in the cloud using Azure. Azure ensures your data is safe, secure, and accessible from anywhere with internet. With an Access GUI you’ll have powerful forms, querying and reporting features. A central database allows for multiple front ends such as a rich forms based Access GUI for your staff, and a web based interface and/or mobile app for your customers, suppliers and contractors.

This solution works well for larger companies for internal and remote desktop use. For a lot of concurrent users or large database, this is the best option as it provides server side processing and faster response times, especially if your company already uses SQL Server. Also, some companies don’t permit Access to be installed but are happy to install a custom .NET solution like this where the GUI is developed in VB.NET or C#.NET.

In this solution, the back end data resides in an Azure SQL Server database hosted with Microsoft in the cloud. This means the GUI can run on any PC, and your external staff or customers can run the application without having to be connected directly to a server. We tend to use this type of solution where portability is essential, all devices are Windows based and Access is not a viable solution.

With Azure’s cloud solutions we can host a SQL Server or MySQL database with Microsoft. Then we can integrate mobile apps in 3 major platforms via ASP web pages and database front ends or GUIs in Visual Studio. We can even integrate your organisation’s existing 3rd party solutions. Azure’s one stop shop approach has transformed the Microsoft development world.

SharePoint goes beyond data capture and document storage. It can also automate and improve the business processes surrounding data capture. For example, for company documents, it can capture context and versions. We can help you utilise SharePoint to improve your company’s productivity, efficiency and effectiveness.

SharePoint is one of many benefits offered as part of the Office 365 suite. We can help move your business to the Microsoft cloud for a truly mobile office.

This web database solution will run in most web browsers and is device independent. When it is not known what devices your clients will be accessing the solution with, this solution may be your only alternative. If you are creating a resalable solution for your clients to use, this solution gives you the most flexibility and security. You can control custom logins/subscriptions and remove users very easily.

We have developers and programmers across Australia with solutions to automate your tasks and let you get back to what you are good at, your business!
