We produce cloud based database solutions most cost effectively with a GUI built in Access to allow users to run the application without needing to be connected directly to a server. It is extremely cost effective to gather data from your clients on any device, store the data in the cloud and access it by your Access front end. The cost is slightly more than an Access Client/Server database solution, with a monthly hosting cost of about $35 per month.

In this solution, the back end data resides in an Azure SQL Server database hosted with Microsoft in the cloud. This means the GUI can run on any PC, and your external staff or customers can run the application without having to be connected directly to a server. We tend to use this type of solution where portability is essential, all devices are Windows based and Access is not a viable solution.

With Azure’s cloud solutions we can host a SQL Server or MySQL database with Microsoft. Then we can integrate mobile apps in 3 major platforms via ASP web pages and database front ends or GUIs in Visual Studio. We can even integrate your organisation’s existing 3rd party solutions. Azure’s one stop shop approach has transformed the Microsoft development world.

SharePoint goes beyond data capture and document storage. It can also automate and improve the business processes surrounding data capture. For example, for company documents, it can capture context and versions. We can help you utilise SharePoint to improve your company’s productivity, efficiency and effectiveness.

SharePoint is one of many benefits offered as part of the Office 365 suite. We can help move your business to the Microsoft cloud for a truly mobile office. The solution cost depends on your requirements.

We create and support a wide variety of cloud based solutions including the following:

Our experts can work in most areas of Microsoft development. If you need help designing or determining what is best for your organisation, then our experienced team can help analyse, design and develop a cloud based solution that suits your organisation’s requirements.

We have developers and programmers across Australia with solutions to automate your tasks and let you get back to what you are good at, your business!
