- If your database has been designed poorly then our experts might be able to fix the major issues, increase the speed, resolve errors or rewrite/upgrade your database.

- If your database is slow our experts could migrate the backend of your database to SQL Server to speed up the database.

- Our consultants can cloud enable your existing database by migrating part of your database to Microsoft Azure. Then your data will be hosted in the cloud with Microsoft and you can access your data from anywhere.

- If upgrading your database is not going to help your situation then our experts can migrate or re-write your database in other platforms like .NET, SQL Server and SharePoint.
