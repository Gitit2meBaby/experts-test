This policy has been formulated in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) set out in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act). The APPs regulate the handling of personal information including its collection, handling, use, disclosure and storage.

A copy of this Policy is available upon request by contacting us at the details set out at paragraph 5 below.

In addition, this Policy applies only to personal information (as defined in paragraph 2) and location information that a User discloses or transmits to Office Experts via the Sites or that is collected by Office Experts in the course of the provision of the Services.

2.     WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?

4.     OFFICE EXPERTS CONSENT PROTOCOL

The type of Personal Information we collect may include your name, address, telephone numbers, e-mail address, what Services you use, and when you use them, location information, information on how you use our Services and how much you spend, information on your browsing activity when visiting our Site, and personal preferences regarding the use of our Services. We do not expect to collect “sensitive information” (such as information about your health) from you, however if we do then such information will be treated in accordance with the relevant rules and requirements of the Privacy Act.

Office Experts will seek your consent to disclose your information to overseas recipients. If you provide this consent, then you should be aware that your rights to make a claim against Office Experts in relation to any misuse of your Personal Information by that overseas recipient will be limited. Office Experts will, however, take reasonable steps to ensure that any overseas recipient does not breach the APPs.

Users of Office Experts may nominate third parties to view or access the account details maintained by Office Experts in respect of that User for any purpose. If a User nominates a third party, that third party may be able to view and/or access their information. By nominating a third party, you explicitly consent to the sharing of your information with that third party by Office Experts.

Office Experts may combine the personal information and/or the location information that a User submits under his or her account with information from other services or third parties in order to provide that User with an enhanced experience and/or to improve the overall quality of the Services. For certain Services, we may give a User an opportunity to opt-out of the combination of such information.

11.       INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO PAY FOR SERVICES ACQUIRED FROM OFFICE EXPERTS

When you purchase goods or Services from Office Experts, any credit card information or other information (if any) you give us to purchase the goods or Services is used to process the payment. The original request/application/enrolment form may be stored securely in the Office Experts office for audit/taxation requirements and to assist individuals who request duplicate information for their own records. These documents are then destroyed. Our database only records that you attended an activity or purchased a service and how much you paid for it. We do not store your credit card details on our database.

12.    INFORMATION SECURITY

Office Experts takes appropriate measures to protect unauthorised access to, or unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction of, the Personal Information and location information transmitted or disclosed to Office Experts. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorised access to systems where User data is collected, stored, and/or maintained.

Office Experts cannot guarantee that information will not be accessed, shared, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or other safeguards. Office Experts recommends that each User take special care in deciding what information is shared, transmitted or disclosed to Office Experts.

13.     DATA INTEGRITY
Office Experts processes User’s Personal Information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable terms that you agree with us. We review data collection, storage, and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the Personal Information needed to provide or improve the Services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our Users to update or correct their Personal Information wherever necessary.

14.    WHEN CAN WE VARY THIS POLICY?
From time to time it may be necessary for us to review and amend this Policy. Subject to the terms of the Privacy Act and the APPs, we reserve the right to amend this Policy at any time. You should check our website from time to time for our latest Policy. A Users’ continued use of the Services constitutes his or her agreement to this Policy and any future revisions.
