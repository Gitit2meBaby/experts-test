With Microsoft Azure we can host your data in the cloud with Microsoft. Your data can then be accessed from our custom built Access databases which can access data from any location, allowing us to create cloud based solutions for Microsoft Access.

If you have an existing Microsoft Access database, we can take your back end database and port it to Azure. If your database doesn’t have a back end we can split it and create a one. We then add some code to point your front end database to Azure. Everything will remain the same except your data will become accessible from any location by being stored in the cloud for everyone to access.

Often you may want to gather data from your clients, suppliers and people of interest who do not have access to your database application. Using Azure we can create hosted web apps that will run on any device through a web browser, gathering data and storing it in your Azure database. You then have instant access to the data through your database application.

While we can also create database solutions without using Azure, the fact that your database in Azure is an SQL Server database that is cloud based means that some of the previous limitations on Access become irrelevant. It also means we can create very cost effective solutions, which in the past was not possible for web/cloud based applications.

The main issue we find with Access solutions arises with non-Windows-based devices. In that case, MS Access is not permitted to be installed or the scale of the database and users is at a very large level.

We have a number of alternatives to Access/Azure including:

There is a monthly fee for hosting a database with Azure. If you would like us to take care of the maintenance and hosting then the current cost is $35 per month for a small to medium size data usage. Once a custom database is delivered there are no further costs unless you require ongoing help, training or additions to the database. We are always here to help you with any ongoing requirements.

We have developers that can work in all areas of Microsoft database development. If you need help designing or determining what is best for your business, our talented database programmers can help analyse and develop a solution that suits your organisation’s requirements. Our experienced consultants are ready to help you out.

We have Access developers across Australia with solutions to automate your tasks and let you get back to what you are good at, your business!
