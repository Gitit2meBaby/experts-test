      "Herron Todd White engaged the services of Office Experts to develop new software for the Quantity Surveying division of our business. Primarily the software was designed to enable our property inspectors to collect onsite data and upload to a back-end database from the field, therefore removing the need to go back to the office to manually upload the data. The secondary phase of our IT development was to create a program that could analyse and process the uploaded data with minimal input, a feat successfully achieved by Office Experts. From our experience the staff at Office Experts have often gone beyond expectations. Their commitment to the project and their drive to deliver the end product is achieved through professionalism, experience and a solid work ethic.",
